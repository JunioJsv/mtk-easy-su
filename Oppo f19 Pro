Welcome to Mtk Easy Su, an application designed to set up bootless super user access using [Magisk](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk) and Mtk-su on MediaTek Android devices. This tool is particularly useful for those interested in leveraging the security breach Mtk-su by [Diplomatic](https://forum.xda-developers.com/member.php?u=8132642).

## Features

- Easily establish bootless super user access on your MediaTek Android device.
- Seamlessly integrates Magisk and Mtk-su for enhanced functionality.
- Empowers advanced users with greater control over the rooting process through terminal-based [mtk-su](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/amazing-temp-root-for-mediatek-armv8-2020-08-24.3922213/).

## Getting Started

To get started with Mtk Easy Su, follow these simple steps:

1. Download the latest version [here](https://github.com/JunioJsv/mediatek-easy-root/releases), but please be aware that you are doing so at your own risk.

2. Ensure you have [Magisk Manager](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk/releases/tag/manager-v8.0.4) installed to manage root access for each application.

3. Before installing the app, disable **Google Play Protect** as recent updates have flagged the app as harmful without valid reasons.

## Important Notes

- Stay informed about the critical MediaTek rootkit affecting millions of Android devices. Check out the XDA article [here](https://www.xda-developers.com/mediatek-su-rootkit-exploit/).

- Be cautious with firmware updates released after March 2020, as they may block the methods utilized by Mtk Easy Su or mtk-su.

- To confirm if you've been granted super user access, check the exit value returned by the log. A value of 0 indicates success and root access.
