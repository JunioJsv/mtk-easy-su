    <string name="about">
        This app help you to use mtk-su to launch Magisk on compatible devices,
        including locked down ones! It runs entirely from the data partition: no
        need to modify the firmware. Root is available for any app that wants it.
        But to manage root access for each application, you must download Magisk manager v7.1.1\n\n
        I really want to work with something that involves programming, if anyone has any
        opportunity please contact us, juniojsv@gmail.com

    <string name="warning">
        Do not update Magisk through Magisk Manager on a locked bootloader or you will brick your device. Including, i
        am not liable for any kind of damage to your device
